# OmniStudio Project Memory

## Project Overview
OmniStudio is a Salesforce DX project focused on creating an adaptive learning and certification system. The project includes 12 open User Stories spanning across multiple phases.

## Development Standards & Best Practices

### Salesforce Best Practices
- **DX Project Structure**: Follow proper metadata organization and source format
- **Development Environment**: Use scratch orgs for development with feature branches
- **Code Coverage**: Target 90% code coverage (exceeding minimum 75% for future development tolerance)
- **Security**: Implement permission sets over profiles, follow principle of least privilege
- **Naming Conventions**: Use consistent naming for all Salesforce components
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling and logging
- **Performance**: Optimize SOQL queries, avoid governor limits, use bulkification patterns
- **Documentation**: Maintain inline comments and technical documentation

### SDLC Lifecycle Approach
1. **Requirements Analysis** - User Stories definition and acceptance criteria
2. **Design** - Technical architecture, data model, and solution design
3. **Development** - Feature implementation in scratch orgs with proper testing
4. **Testing** - Unit tests (90% coverage), integration testing, and UAT
5. **Deployment** - Sandbox → Production pipeline with validation
6. **Maintenance** - Monitoring, support, and continuous improvement

### Quality Gates
- **Code Reviews**: Mandatory peer review before merge
- **Testing**: 90% code coverage minimum with meaningful assertions
- **Static Analysis**: Use PMD/SonarQube for code quality checks
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing for critical components
- **Security Review**: OWASP compliance and security scanning

## Repository Information
- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/zerovizboss/OmniStudio
- **Current Branch**: main
- **Project Type**: Salesforce DX (OmniStudio framework)
- **Languages**: Shell (96.2%), Apex (2.2%), JavaScript (1.2%), HTML (0.4%)

## Session History

### Session 1 - 2025-08-12
**Tasks Completed:**
- ✅ Connected to GitHub repository https://github.com/zerovizboss/OmniStudio
- ✅ Reviewed repository structure and identified Salesforce DX project setup
- ✅ Found 12 open User Stories across 3 phases (Adaptive Learning, Testing, Production)
- ✅ Created MEMORY.md file for tracking progress
- ✅ Established Salesforce Best Practices and 90% code coverage target
- ✅ Created comprehensive Epic structure with detailed objectives
- ✅ Integrated with GitHub Project Board for status tracking
- ✅ Verified target repository and confirmed all Epics created successfully

**Key Findings:**
- Project has 40+ total open issues, with 12 being core User Stories (#38-#49)
- All User Stories were created on July 31, 2025 and are ready for development
- Project is in advanced stages (Phase 8-10) focusing on business logic, testing, and production
- Repository correctly configured with proper Git remotes and clean working directory

**Epic Structure Created:**
- **Epic #50**: Phase 8 - Business Logic Components (37 pts) - Issues #38-#41
- **Epic #51**: Phase 9 - Quality Assurance & Testing (55+ pts) - Issues #42-#45  
- **Epic #52**: Phase 10 - Production & Launch (31+ pts) - Issues #46-#49
- All Epics include technical components, success criteria, and SDLC dependencies

**Development Standards Established:**
- 90% code coverage target (exceeding Salesforce 75% minimum for future tolerance)
- Salesforce DX best practices (scratch orgs, metadata organization, security)
- Traditional SDLC lifecycle (Requirements → Design → Development → Testing → Deployment)
- Quality gates (code reviews, static analysis, performance testing, security review)

**GitHub Project Board Integration:**
- Project URL: https://github.com/users/zerovizboss/projects/3 ("OmniStudio Training")
- Status Workflow: Todo → In Progress → Done
- All 3 Epics (#50-#52) added to project board
- Process established: Update User Story status as development progresses

**Session Summary:**
Complete project setup and planning phase completed. All 12 User Stories organized into 3 comprehensive Epics with clear development path. Ready to begin Phase 8 development work starting with adaptive learning business logic components.

**Next Session Priorities:**
- Begin development of Epic #50 (Phase 8: Business Logic Components)
- Start with User Story #38: Adaptive Question Selection (Decision Matrices)
- Implement 90% code coverage testing strategy
- Update project board status as User Stories are completed
