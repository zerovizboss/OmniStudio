# OmniStudio Project Memory

## Project Overview
OmniStudio is a Salesforce DX project focused on creating an adaptive learning and certification system. The project includes 12 open User Stories spanning across multiple phases.

## Development Standards & Best Practices

### Salesforce Best Practices
- **DX Project Structure**: Follow proper metadata organization and source format
- **Development Environment**: Use scratch orgs for development with feature branches
- **Code Coverage**: Target 90% code coverage (exceeding minimum 75% for future development tolerance)
- **Security**: Implement permission sets over profiles, follow principle of least privilege
- **Naming Conventions**: Use consistent naming for all Salesforce components
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling and logging
- **Performance**: Optimize SOQL queries, avoid governor limits, use bulkification patterns
- **Documentation**: Maintain inline comments and technical documentation

### SDLC Lifecycle Approach
1. **Requirements Analysis** - User Stories definition and acceptance criteria
2. **Design** - Technical architecture, data model, and solution design
3. **Development** - Feature implementation in scratch orgs with proper testing
4. **Testing** - Unit tests (90% coverage), integration testing, and UAT
5. **Deployment** - Sandbox → Production pipeline with validation
6. **Maintenance** - Monitoring, support, and continuous improvement

### Quality Gates
- **Code Reviews**: Mandatory peer review before merge
- **Testing**: 90% code coverage minimum with meaningful assertions
- **Static Analysis**: Use PMD/SonarQube for code quality checks
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing for critical components
- **Security Review**: OWASP compliance and security scanning

## Claude Code Usage & Cost Monitoring

### Cost Tracking Strategy
- **Command**: Use `/cost` to check current session usage
- **Average Baseline**: $6 per developer per day (industry average)
- **Target Budget**: Stay under $12 per day (90th percentile threshold)
- **Monthly Estimate**: $100-200 per developer (team usage with Sonnet 4)

### Cost Optimization Practices
- **Context Management**: Use `/compact` to reduce conversation history
- **Specific Queries**: Write targeted, focused questions to minimize token usage  
- **Task Breakdown**: Split complex tasks into smaller, manageable chunks
- **Background Processing**: ~1 cent/day for Haiku generation and summarization
- **Session Management**: Clear history between unrelated tasks

### Usage Monitoring Setup
- **Telemetry**: Available via OpenTelemetry (OTel) integration
- **Metrics Tracked**: Session count, lines of code modified, token usage, cost per session
- **Configuration**: `export CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY=1`
- **Dashboard Integration**: Compatible with Prometheus, Datadog, Honeycomb

### Cost Optimization Strategies for Development Sessions

**Pre-Session Planning:**
- Review MEMORY.md to understand current context and avoid re-reading
- Plan User Story implementation approach before starting development
- Use specific, targeted questions rather than broad exploratory queries
- Break large User Stories into smaller, focused implementation chunks

**During Development:**
- Use `/compact` command when conversation history gets long
- Focus on single User Story completion per session when possible  
- Leverage existing code patterns and architecture decisions
- Minimize repetitive file reads by referencing previous analysis

**Code Implementation Efficiency:**
- Follow established patterns from previous User Stories
- Reuse test class structures and helper methods
- Build incrementally on existing components
- Batch related file operations (staging, commits, pushes)

**Session Management:**
- Track deliverables per session to measure cost effectiveness
- Use `/cost` command at key milestones during development
- Clear conversation history between unrelated Epic phases
- Document key decisions in MEMORY.md to avoid re-analysis

**Token Usage Reduction:**
- Reference existing architecture decisions rather than re-analyzing
- Use concise commit messages and documentation  
- Leverage previous test patterns rather than creating from scratch
- Focus on completion metrics: User Stories closed, tests passing, code coverage achieved

**Session Summary:**
Complete project setup and planning phase completed. All 12 User Stories organized into 3 comprehensive Epics with clear development path. Ready to begin Phase 8 development work starting with adaptive learning business logic components.

**Next Session Priorities:**
- Continue with remaining Epic #50 User Stories (#39-#41)
